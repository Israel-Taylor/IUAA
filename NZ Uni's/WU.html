<!--4. Application Process
The University of Waikato offers a streamlined online application process for both domestic and international students. Prospective students can apply through the university's official website, where they can select their desired program, submit academic transcripts, proof of English language proficiency, and other required documents. For international students, it's advisable to apply at least three months before the intended start date to allow ample time for visa processing and accommodation arrangements.

Admission Requirements
Undergraduate applicants must meet New Zealand's University Entrance requirements or their country's equivalent. For international students, this typically includes a high school diploma with satisfactory grades and proof of English proficiency, such as an IELTS score of 6.0 or equivalent. Postgraduate applicants generally need a bachelor's degree with a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Specific programs may have additional requirements, such as portfolios for creative disciplines or work experience for professional courses.

7. Acceptance Rates
The University of Waikato has an acceptance rate of approximately 72%, indicating a moderately selective admission process. This rate reflects the university's commitment to maintaining high academic standards while being accessible to a diverse range of students. Acceptance rates can vary by program; for instance, competitive fields like law or engineering may have lower acceptance rates due to higher demand and specific entry requirements.

10. Localization
Waikato University offers various pathways to support students from diverse backgrounds. For Māori students, the university provides tailored support through Te Pua Wānanga ki te Ao, which offers academic guidance, cultural support, and scholarships. International students are also well-supported, with dedicated services to assist with cultural integration, academic writing, and career development. Additionally, the university offers flexible study options, including part-time and distance learning, to accommodate students' varying needs.

11. Application Tracking

Once a decision is made, applicants receive an Offer of Place, which they can accept or decline. Accepted students are then guided through the enrollment process, including course selection and orientation.-->
