<!--4. Application Process
The University of Canterbury employs a comprehensive online application system for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Applicants submit academic records, proof of English proficiency, and other documentation relevant to their chosen program. International applicants are encouraged to apply several months in advance due to visa processing times. The university offers guidance throughout the application, with support available for those requiring assistance. Deadlines are published annually and vary by program and semester intake.

5. Admission Requirements
Applicants must meet the New Zealand University Entrance criteria or provide equivalent qualifications. Programs such as engineering, law, and health sciences may require specific prerequisite subjects or higher grade point averages. English language requirements typically involve IELTS scores of at least 6.0 for undergraduate and 6.5 for postgraduate study. Work experience or portfolios may be necessary for specialized fields. The university also recognizes alternative entry pathways for mature or non-traditional students.

7. Acceptance Rates
The acceptance rate at the University of Canterbury is approximately 65%, reflecting moderate selectivity across programs. Popular faculties such as engineering and law may have more competitive admission standards due to limited capacity and high demand. The university maintains an inclusive approach, offering foundation and bridging programs to assist students who do not meet direct entry criteria.
