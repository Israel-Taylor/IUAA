<!--4. Application Process
The University of Canterbury employs a comprehensive online application system for undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Applicants submit academic records, proof of English proficiency, and other documentation relevant to their chosen program. International applicants are encouraged to apply several months in advance due to visa processing times. The university offers guidance throughout the application, with support available for those requiring assistance. Deadlines are published annually and vary by program and semester intake.

5. Admission Requirements
Applicants must meet the New Zealand University Entrance criteria or provide equivalent qualifications. Programs such as engineering, law, and health sciences may require specific prerequisite subjects or higher grade point averages. English language requirements typically involve IELTS scores of at least 6.0 for undergraduate and 6.5 for postgraduate study. Work experience or portfolios may be necessary for specialized fields. The university also recognizes alternative entry pathways for mature or non-traditional students.

7. Acceptance Rates
The acceptance rate at the University of Canterbury is approximately 65%, reflecting moderate selectivity across programs. Popular faculties such as engineering and law may have more competitive admission standards due to limited capacity and high demand. The university maintains an inclusive approach, offering foundation and bridging programs to assist students who do not meet direct entry criteria.

10. Localization
The university provides extensive support for Māori students, including scholarships and dedicated academic services through Te Rāngai Ako me ngā Toi Māori. International students receive comprehensive orientation, language support, and cultural integration programs. Christchurch’s unique location offers students a balance of urban amenities and outdoor lifestyle opportunities. Flexible learning options, including online and part-time study, accommodate a wide range of student circumstances.

11. Application Tracking
Applicants can track their progress through an online portal that provides real-time updates on the status of their application and any outstanding requirements. Upon receiving an offer, students can accept it electronically and proceed to enrollment and course registration. The university also provides personalized support to help new students transition smoothly into university life.-->
