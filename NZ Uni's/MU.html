<!--4. Application Process
Massey University provides an online application portal for both domestic and international students. Applicants can create an account, select their desired program, and submit the necessary documents, including academic transcripts, proof of English language proficiency, and a personal statement. For international students, it's recommended to apply at least three months before the intended start date to ensure sufficient time for visa processing and accommodation arrangements.

5. Admission Requirements
Undergraduate applicants must meet the university's entrance requirements, which typically include a high school diploma with satisfactory grades and proof of English proficiency. For international students, acceptable English proficiency tests include IELTS (minimum score of 6.0), TOEFL (minimum score of 80), or PTE Academic (minimum score of 50). Postgraduate applicants generally need a bachelor's degree with a minimum GPA of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale. Some programs may have additional requirements, such as work experience or a portfolio.

7. Acceptance Rates
Massey University has an acceptance rate of approximately 60–70%, reflecting its moderately selective admission process. The university assesses applicants based on academic records, English language proficiency, and program-specific criteria. Acceptance rates can vary by program; for instance, competitive fields like veterinary science or aviation may have lower acceptance rates due to higher demand and specific entry requirements.

10. Localization
Massey University offers various pathways to support students from diverse backgrounds. For Māori students, the university provides tailored support through Te Rau Puawai, which offers academic guidance, cultural support, and scholarships. International students are also well-supported, with dedicated services to assist with cultural integration, academic writing, and career development. Additionally, the university offers flexible study options, including part-time and distance learning, to accommodate students' varying needs.

Once a decision is made, applicants receive an Offer of Place, which they can accept or decline. Accepted students are then guided through the enrollment process, including course selection and orientation.-->
