<!--4. Application Process
The University of Otago utilizes an online application system where students submit academic records, English language proof, and other documentation. Applications open several months before semester start dates, with early application encouraged for popular programs such as medicine, dentistry, and health sciences due to high competition. Both domestic and international students apply through the same portal, which includes instructions for attaching necessary documents and paying any applicable fees.

5. Admission Requirements
Undergraduate admission requires meeting New Zealand University Entrance standards or an equivalent. Highly competitive programs (e.g., medicine, dentistry, physiotherapy) have additional requirements such as higher academic thresholds, aptitude tests (e.g., UMAT), or interviews. English proficiency standards are generally IELTS 6.5 with no band below 6.0 for international students. Postgraduate programs require a relevant bachelor's degree with good academic standing, and some programs may require research proposals or portfolios.

7. Acceptance Rates
Otago's overall acceptance rate is approximately 50%, reflecting its status as one of New Zealand's more selective universities, especially in health and science disciplines. Programs like medicine and dentistry have acceptance rates below 10% due to limited places and strong competition. The university balances academic excellence with comprehensive student support to facilitate success.

10. Localization
Otago provides robust support for Māori and Pasifika students, including dedicated scholarships, mentoring, and academic advising through the Māori Centre and Pacific Islands Centre. International students receive orientation programs, English language support, and cultural activities to help integrate into university life. Dunedin's student-focused city environment offers a rich blend of academic and social experiences. Flexible study options are available but many programs require full-time attendance.

11. Application Tracking
Applicants can monitor their application status through the online portal, where they receive notifications of missing documents, interview invitations, and final decisions. Upon acceptance, students receive a formal offer letter with instructions to accept and enroll online. The university provides comprehensive guidance on enrollment, course selection, and orientation to help new students transition smoothly.-->
