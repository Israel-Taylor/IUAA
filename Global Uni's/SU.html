<!--Stanford University (USA)
Stanford, situated in Silicon Valley, is known for innovation, entrepreneurship, and academic excellence. It receives over 47,000 undergraduate applications annually and admits about 3.9%. Applications are made via the Common App and include essays, school reports, recommendations, and test scores (optional recently). Stanford values academic achievement combined with leadership, creativity, and social impact.
Tuition and fees total roughly USD $85,000 annually, but Stanford offers generous need-based financial aid for many international students. New Zealand applicants need high academic achievement (NCEA Excellence), strong test scores, and a record of leadership or innovation.
