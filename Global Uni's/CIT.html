            California Institute of Technology (Caltech) is one of the worldâ€™s most trusted and successful STEM-focused universities, located in Pasadena, California. 
            Known for its cutting-edge research, and exceptional academic environment, Caltech has an undergraduate acceptance rate of around 3.9%.

            Applications are submitted via the online application process. 
            New Zealand applicants should present exceptional academic performance in maths and science, typically NCEA Level 3 with Excellence endorsements, 
            or equivalent qualifications such as Cambridge A Levels. Caltech is test-optional, 
            but submitting strong SAT scores can be beneficial. 
            Applicants must also submit teacher recommendations and demonstrate impressive STEM achievements, problem-solving ability, 
            and genuine intellectual curiosity.
            
            Annual tuition is approximately NZD $105,000, with total costs (including housing and fees) exceeding NZD $130,000 per year. 
            Need-based financial aid is available to international students, 
            and Caltech meets 100% of demonstrated need, but merit scholarships are rare and difficult to earn.
