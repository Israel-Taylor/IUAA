<!--Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (USA)
MIT is a world leader in science, engineering, and technology education, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The undergraduate acceptance rate is around 4% from 20,000+ applicants each year, making it extremely selective. MIT uses its own application portal rather than the Common App and requires academic transcripts, essays, and test scores (SAT or ACT, though test-optional options have recently been offered). The admissions focus is on strong STEM skills, problem-solving ability, and intellectual curiosity.
Annual tuition is approximately USD $57,000, with total costs near USD $80,000. MIT meets full demonstrated financial need for admitted international students and offers generous aid. It is ideal for students from New Zealand with outstanding academic records (NCEA Excellence or equivalent), especially in maths and sciences, and who have demonstrated interest through research, competitions, or projects.
