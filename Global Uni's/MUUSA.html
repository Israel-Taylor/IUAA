            <h4>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a global leader in science, engineering, technology, and innovation, located in Cambridge, 
              Massachusetts. Known for its world-changing research, 
              MIT constantly ranks among the top universities in the world. It receives over 20,000 undergraduate applications annually and admits about 4%.<br><br>

              MIT uses its own application portal, and applicants must submit necessary school transcripts, essays, teacher recommendations, 
              and standardized test scores (SAT or ACT). Additionally, 
              students are encouraged to submit optional creative or research portfolios if applicable/possible.<br><br>
              
              MIT places significant focus on STEM, problem-solving, and intellectual curiosity, but also values students who show collaboration, 
              resilience, and a drive to contribute meaningfully to the world or to make a  diffference. New Zealand applicants are expected to have NCEA Level 3 with Excellence, 
              or equivalent results in Cambridge A Levels. Success in national/international STEM competitions, coding projects, Olympiads, 
              or independent research can strengthen an application.<br><br>
              
              Annual tuition is approximately NZD $100,000, with full cost of attendance 
              (tuition, housing, meals, fees) around NZD $135,000 to $140,000. MIT is generous to international students, 
              including New Zealanders, and meets 100% of demonstrated financial need with no need to  pay them back afterwards.

<!--Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (USA)
MIT is a world leader in science, engineering, and technology education, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The undergraduate acceptance rate is around 4% from 20,000+ applicants each year, making it extremely selective. MIT uses its own application portal rather than the Common App and requires academic transcripts, essays, and test scores (SAT or ACT, though test-optional options have recently been offered). The admissions focus is on strong STEM skills, problem-solving ability, and intellectual curiosity.
Annual tuition is approximately USD $57,000, with total costs near USD $80,000. MIT meets full demonstrated financial need for admitted international students and offers generous aid. It is ideal for students from New Zealand with outstanding academic records (NCEA Excellence or equivalent), especially in maths and sciences, and who have demonstrated interest through research, competitions, or projects.
