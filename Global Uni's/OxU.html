<!--University of Oxford (UK)
The University of Oxford, located in Oxford, England, is one of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities. Oxford receives over 23,000 undergraduate applications yearly but admits just over 3,200, an acceptance rate around 14%, though for international students it's often lower depending on the course.
