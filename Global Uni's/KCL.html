            <h4>King's College London (KCL) is a prestigious, research-intensive university situated in the heart of London, known for strong programmes in law, 
            health sciences, politics, and international relations. Each year, 
            it receives about 30,000 undergraduate applications and has an overall admission rate of approximately 15–20%, 
            reflecting its competitive entry standards.<br><br>
              </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Applications are submitted via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), the UK’s centralised university application system.</li>
              <li>New Zealand students need to demonstrate excellent academic achievement—typically NCEA Level 3 with Excellence endorsements in relevant subjects—as well as meeting specific course requirements.</li>
              <li>Some programmes, such as Law, require additional admissions tests like the LNAT (Law National Aptitude Test), which assesses critical thinking and reasoning skills.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>
            Tuition fees for international students range from £22,000 to £40,000 per year (~NZD 47,000–86,000), depending on the course of study. 
            Living costs in London generally add around £15,000 annually. While King’s offers some merit-based scholarships and bursaries, 
            these are limited and highly competitive, so students should plan financially accordingly.</h4>
