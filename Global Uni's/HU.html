<!--Harvard University (USA)
Harvard University, located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is widely regarded as one of the world’s most prestigious universities. Known for its leadership in education, research, and global influence, 
Harvard offers over 50 undergraduate majors across arts, sciences, and professional disciplines. The undergraduate admissions process is highly selective, with an acceptance rate around 3–4% from roughly 57,000 applicants annually. 
Applicants apply through the Common Application, submitting school transcripts, standardized test scores (SAT or ACT), personal essays, and teacher recommendations. Harvard uses a holistic admissions process, valuing academic excellence, 
leadership, extracurricular involvement, and personal character. For New Zealand students, achieving NCEA Excellence results or equivalent is essential, alongside strong standardized test scores. 
Harvard’s tuition for 2024 stands at approximately USD $57,000 annually, with total costs (including housing and fees) reaching around USD $83,000. However, Harvard is need-blind for all applicants, including international students, 
and meets 100% of demonstrated financial need. Families earning under USD $85,000 often pay little or nothing, making Harvard financially accessible to many high-achieving students.
Harvard suits students who are academically gifted, motivated leaders, and passionate about impact and innovation. Its broad liberal arts curriculum encourages intellectual exploration before specialization.
