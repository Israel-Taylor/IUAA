<!--Yale University (USA)
Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut, is renowned for its strong liberal arts tradition, residential college system, and outstanding graduate programs in law and the arts. Yale receives about 50,000 undergraduate applications annually and admits around 4.5%, making it one of the most selective US universities. Applications use the Common Application, requiring academic records, essays, recommendations, and standardized tests (SAT or ACT), though test-optional policies sometimes apply.
Yale emphasizes academic excellence combined with distinctive personal qualities and leadership. New Zealand applicants typically need NCEA Excellence or equivalent, strong standardized test scores, and compelling extracurriculars. The total annual cost is near USD $85,000, but Yale meets 100% of demonstrated need for all admitted students, including internationals, making it financially accessible for many.
Yale's academic environment suits students who value intellectual breadth, critical thinking, and creative expression, especially in humanities, social sciences, law, and the arts.
