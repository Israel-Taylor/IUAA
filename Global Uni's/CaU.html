<!--University of Cambridge (UK)
The University of Cambridge, one of the world's oldest and most prestigious universities, admits about 21% of the 20,000+ undergraduate applicants each year. 
Applications are submitted via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) by mid-October and require strong academic achievement (such as NCEA Excellence), course-specific admissions tests, and interviews. 
Tuition fees for international students vary widely depending on the course, typically between £25,000 and £60,000 per year, with living costs estimated at around £12,000 to £15,000 annually. 
Cambridge offers some scholarships and bursaries for international undergraduates, although these are limited and highly competitive. 
Prospective students should explore both university-wide and college-specific funding options to help manage expenses. Cambridge is best suited to students who are passionate about their chosen subject, 
comfortable with academic rigor, and prepared for early specialization in their studies.
