            <h4>University College London (UCL) is a leading multidisciplinary research university in central London, 
              consistently ranked among the top 10 universities inthe world. UCL is known for a large range of academic options and innovation across arts, sciences, engineering, 
              health, and social sciences, and offers more than 400 undergraduate programmes.<br><br>

              UCL receives over 38,000 undergraduate applications annually and admits roughly 35% of applicants overall, 
              though acceptance rates vary significantly by programme. Highly competitive courses such as Law, Medicine, Economics, 
              and Psychology often have lower acceptance rates, especially for international students.<br><br>
              
              Applications must be submitted through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) by 15 January for most courses, 
              though Medicine and Oxford/Cambridge concurrent applicants must apply by 15 October. 
              New Zealand students typically need NCEA Level 3 with Excellence endorsement, particularly in relevant subjects. 
              Cambridge A Levels are also accepted. Some courses require additional assessments, 
              such as the LNAT (for Law) or interviews (for Medicine or Architecture).<br><br>
              
              Tuition fees for international students range from $52,000 to $97,000 NZD, depending on the degree.
              UCL offers a few merit-based scholarships and regional awards 
              but financial aid is limited for international undergraduates and should not be relied upon to fully fund your study.
